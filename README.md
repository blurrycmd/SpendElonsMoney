There might be issues regarding some sfx not playing. That's because some browsers (for example Chrome) block "3rd party cookies".


Basically, ".mp3" and ".ogg" files are mistakenly identified as third-party cookies, preventing them from being played.


Fix: Enable 3rd Party Cookies for this Website.
